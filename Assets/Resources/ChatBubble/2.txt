-Meow?
-It's you
-Don't take it wrong, I still don't welcome you here
-What are you doing?
-Play? Eat? Meow way.

-Humph!!
-Yeah... yeah..
-This is boring
-No, YOU're boring
-Well, whatever, at least you gave me food

-It's not like I hate dry cat foods, but who expects to get them like, everyday?
-Well at least you're here to play
-I am still better than you on any game
-Are you just going to stare or what?
-Leave me alone

-I still don't like you
-Don't get high on yourself just because I talked to you more often
-Cute? Me? You're lying!
-You're bugging me!
-Stop!!
