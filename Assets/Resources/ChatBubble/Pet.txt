purr...
Meow~
Ahh, yes. Pet me in the head!
I like it when you scratch my backs
NOT MY TUMMY!!
MEOW!!!
Meow?
I know you really adore my paws
And you're also in love with my toebeans
My nose is wet? It means I am healthy!
I like it when you scratch the back of my ears
Oh, again!
Ahh... it feels really good.
Not my tail, meow.
I'm purring, not snoring
Keep going!
Your hands are so warm...
Hey, pet me more!
I want to cuddle into you right now, meow~
My chins! it tickles~!!
