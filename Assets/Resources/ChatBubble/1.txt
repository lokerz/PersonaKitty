-Who are you?
-Go away.
-Why are you still here?
-Hey
-Meeeoooww~

-How long are you going to be here??
-Stop staring and do some work!
-Don't you have something else to do?
-*sigh* alright, whatever
-What?

-Oh, it's just you
-Well?
-Looking at you makes me wanna scratch all around
-Are you messing with me?
-Hey!!

-Are you looking for something?
-You're such a weirdo, meow
-And I do NOT befriend a weirdo
-I don't like you
-I will never like you

-I've had a bad day, don't make it worse
-Meow meow meow
-You're annoying, I'd better find some catnip
-Ugh!!
-Stop looking, and do something!
